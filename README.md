# Research Track I - Second Assignment
The assignment consist of a development of a package that interact with a simulation of a simple robot in Gazebo. The package contains three nodes:
- Node A: A node that implements an action client, allowing the user to set a target (x, y) or to cancel it. The node
also publishes the robot position and velocity as a custom message (x,y, vel_x, vel_z), by relying on the values
published on the topic /odom. Please consider that, if you cannot implement everything in the same node, you
can also develop two different nodes, one implementing the user interface and one implementing the publisher
of the custom message.
- Node B: A service node that, when called, prints the number of goals reached and cancelled.
- Node C: A node that subscribes to the robot’s position and velocity (using the custom message) and prints the
distance of the robot from the target and the robot’s average speed. Use a parameter to set how fast the
node publishes the information. 
- Has also been implemented a **.launch** file that starts the whole simulation and the Noe A. 

# Intalling & Run
Clone this project and the simulation repository(https://github.com/CarmineD8/assignment_2_2022) inside a ROS workspace. Before starting anything you have to run the master process of ROS
```bash
  rocore
```
Then to start the simulation run the launch file
```bash
   roslaunch Assignment_2 assignment_2.launch
```
To call process B or C:
```bash
  rosrun Assignment_2 node_b.py
  rosrun Assignment_2 node_c.py
```

#How works
- Process A:

Initialize object Pose() and Twist()
global variable pub_info, target_reached, target_canceled, service, pub_target
